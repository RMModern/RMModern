# Rocket

This is a fork of **Rocket** for Unturned maintained by the game developers (SDG) after the resignation of its original community team. Using this fork is recommended because it preserves compatibility, and has fixes for important legacy Rocket issues like multithreading exceptions and teleportation exploits.

## Installation

1. Copy the Rocket.Unturned module from the Extras directory.
2. Paste it into the game's Modules directory.
